# Path Planning Robot Project
****
##### Problem Statement:
We are considering the problem of path planning for a mobile robot
operating in a planar scene with obstacles.
It is required to generate a collision-free path to a predefined target point T
or to prove that T cannot be reached. The maze map and the positions of the
obstacles will be given in advance.

##### Requirements:
###### Hardware: 
- 2 * DC motors with optical encoders, Wheels.
- Microcontroller board (Arduino Uno board).
- Male to female USB long extension cable.
- PCB design components (Wires, Soldering Iron, Soldering wire, Acid).
- Robot Body (Acrylic or Wood).
- DC motor Driver (Opto-coupler, MOSFET transistors IRF540n , 330 Ohm Resistors)

###### Software: 
* [Proteus] (Any simulator you like).
* [Arduino IDE].
* [Python IDLE] (Any IDE you like).
